# Single-Axis-Solar-Tracker
Solar Panels allow to use Sun's energy as a clean energy resource. Solar Trackers allow Solar Panels to rotate to the direction where the Sun is, pretty much like a Sunflower, this is a Single Axis Solar Tracker, an optimized solution for Global warming and Climate change, which I've built using an Arduino.
